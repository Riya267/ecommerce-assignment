## ðŸ§± Layout Approach

The project follows a **modular, feature-based folder structure**. Each UI component (e.g., `ProductCard`, `Categories`, `Navbar`) resides in its own folder for **better separation of concerns**. Redux state is also organized by feature to improve **code clarity, scalability, and maintainability**. This approach makes components **reusable and easier to test or modify** independently.

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness Considerations

The UI is built with a **mobile-first design**, ensuring a smooth experience on small devices. For layout, a **responsive CSS grid** is used.
